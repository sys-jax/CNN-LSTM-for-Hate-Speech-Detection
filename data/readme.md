### Data
##  What dataset and why: 
# It is widely recognized that a major limitation of state of the art is the lack of comparative evaluation on publicly available datasets. To collect the data, we have used one of the largest datasets that available publicly, according to the paper. The dataset contains three distinct categories: “hate speech,” “offensive,” “neither,” which labeled as 0,1,2. The reason why we use this dataset is the larger scale of the dataset, the better training result likely to improve testing performance. The dataset was also chosen because the source is importantly reliable provided by the researchers, they have used the Twitter API that they searched for tweets containing terms from the lexicon, and extracted the time-line for each user, resulting in a set of 85.4 million tweets. From this corpus, they took a random sample from this and asked CrowdFlower(CF) workers to label each tweet as one of three categories: hate speech, offensive, and neither. The reason why it is reliable is that the workers’ label for tweets and hate detection will be the best training dataset for the machine and gives the most likely learning result to detect hate speech as a human.
