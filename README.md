### CNN-LSTM-for-Hate-Speech-Detection
## In recent years, hate speech has become a controversial issue with the popularity of social media. In EU, surveys, and reports focusing on young people in the EEA region, and it shows 80% of respondents have encountered hate speech online, 40% have felt attacked or threatened, and 5% of respondents posted hate speech. (Eeagrants, 2012). Despite a large number of scientific studies to address the problem, existing methods are limited in several ways. For years, a large number of social media companies such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter have invested and built models to address this issue, and they have estimated enormous human resources and funds. However, they are still being criticized for not doing enough. The process is human resource-intensive, time-consuming, and not sustainable or scalable in reality. In this project, we focus on dealing with hate speech from Twitter by building hate speech detection model in tweets that are written in English. I.e., sexism, religious discrimination, racism. Therefore, we present a machine learning model of combining CNN and LSTM for hate speech detection of Twitter. It is significant and exciting that we can work on this topic.
